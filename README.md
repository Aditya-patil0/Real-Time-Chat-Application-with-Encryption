# Real-Time Chat Application with Encryption

## Project Overview
A Java chat application offering real-time messaging with secure end-to-end encryption, ensuring privacy and data protection. Developed using Java Swing for the interface and Socket programming for seamless communication between users. AES encryption has been implemented for message security, combining networking and security concepts in Java to build a reliable, privacy-focused communication tool.

## Features
- Real-time messaging between users.
- End-to-end encryption using AES for message security.
- User-friendly interface developed with Java Swing.
- Secure socket communication for seamless data transfer.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language for development.
- **Java Swing**: For creating the graphical user interface.
- **Socket Programming**: For establishing client-server communication.
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: For encrypting and securing messages.
